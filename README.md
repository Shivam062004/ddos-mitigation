`DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation using Machine Learning`

---

## 📌 Introduction

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a massive volume of traffic. These attacks typically originate from multiple compromised systems, making them difficult to detect and mitigate.

With the rapid growth of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), centralized control introduces new security challenges, especially against large-scale DDoS attacks. This project focuses on detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks in SDN environments using Machine Learning techniques.

## 🎯 Motivation

Mission-critical systems operating in modern networks cannot afford downtime. DDoS attacks pose a serious threat to availability and performance.  
By integrating Machine Learning with SDN, intelligent traffic analysis and rapid mitigation can be achieved, improving network resilience against evolving attack patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement an SDN-based network using Mininet and Ryu Controller  
- Generate datasets for normal and malicious traffic  
- Apply Machine Learning algorithms for DDoS detection  
- Design and integrate a mitigation mechanism
